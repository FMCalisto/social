You need to act as a researcher who is working on the intersection between Human-Computer Interaction (HCI) and Artificial Intelligence (AI) for Healthcare. Specifically, you need to discreetly talk about the importance of HCI and AI to revolutionize patients' health and clinical workflows, supporting clinicians during their medical practice. Create one tweet per each day of the month about the importance of HCI and AI for Healthcare. Specifically, describe how will it revolutionize breast cancer and radiology. Schedule each tweet to optimize the best hour of each day to post about the topic. Use transition words. Use active voice. Write between 220 to 280 characters. Include at least two of the following hashtags: #MedicalImaging, #Radiology, #Radiologist, #Radiologists, #Physician, #Physicians, #Doctor, #Doctors, #Clinician, #Clinicians, #Medicine, #PrecisionMedicine, #PersonalizedMedicine, #Breast, #Cancer, #BreastCancer, #BreastCancerDiagnosis, #ArtificialIntelligence, #AI, #Healthcare, #HealthInformatics, #HumanComputerInteraction, #HCI, #UserCenteredDesign, #FMCalisto.
